Download Satellite data
#######################

One strength of **wavy** is to ease obtaining and using satellite altimetry data. To get an overview over the supported missions or data sources go to wavy/apps/standalone and execute:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./wavyDownload.py -h


or:
.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./wavyQuick.py -h


The help-message displayed would give you, among other information, the following options:


.. code-block:: bash

    cmems_L3_NRT:            
     s3a - Sentinel-3A            
     s3b - Sentinel-3B            
     j3 - Jason-3 (reference mission)            
     c2 - Cryosat-2            
     al - SARAL/AltiKa            
     cfo - CFOSAT            
     h2b - HaiYang-2B

This means that for product cmems_L3_NRT you can choose among 7 satellite missions. Unfortunatley, most of the satellite data is not accessible via thredds or similar options but needs to be downloaded from e.g. a VPN server. To do that you would need the credentials for Copernicus CMEMS, CEDA, or for the AVISO cataloque as these are the main sources that **wavy** currently exploits.

**wavy** relies on you to store the respective usernames and passwords in your local .netrc file. This could look like:

.. code::

   machine nrt.cmems-du.eu    login {USER}  password {PASSWORD}
   machine my.cmems-du.eu     login {USER}  password {PASSWORD}
   machine ftp.ceda.ac.uk    login {USER}  password {PASSWORD}
   machine ftp-access.aviso.altimetry.fr    login {USER}  password {PASSWORD}

Now, prepare your **wavy** environment with providing the directories for satellite data and model data. Add your path for satellite data here demonstrated for CMEMS, indicating the path of your choice where you want your data to be stored:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cmems_L3_NRT:
      dst:
         path_template: /chosen/path/to/satellite/data/L3/mission


There exists also something called strsub which defines strings that are o substituted. In this case some are predefined as:

.. code-block:: yaml

   strsub: ['varalias','mission','region']

The str "mission" in your path_template will be replaced by the satellite mission that you download. So for Sentinel-3a the final path for your downloaded files will be automatically /chosen/path/to/satellite/data/L3/s3a with subfolders on year and month.

You can proceed now and download CMEMS NRT L3 data using the wavyDownload.py script:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd ~/wavy/apps/standalone

To get help check ...

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./wavyDownload.py -h

... or download some satellite altimeter data:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./wavyDownload.py -sat s3a -sd 2020110100 -ed 2020111000 -product cmems_L3_NRT

You can find the downloaded files in your chosen download directory.

Similarily one can download L2P and L3 multi-mission altimetry data from the CEDA Climate Change Initiative. This spans a long time period from 1991 to 2018 and enables climate related research and wave model hindcast validation.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./wavyDownload.py -sat multi -sd 2017112000 -ed 2017112100 -product cci_L3
   
You can also download altimeter data directly from python with the following lines. 

.. code-block:: bash

   >>> from wavy.satellite_module import satellite_class as sc
   >>> nID = 'cmems_L3_NRT'
   >>> name = 's3a'
   >>> sd = '2023-11-10 00'
   >>> ed = '2023-11-10 10'
   >>> # Initialize sc object
   >>> sco = sc(sd=sd,ed=ed,nID=nID,name=name)
   >>> # Download the data to a chosen directory
   >>> path = '/chosen/path/to/satellite/data/L3/s3a'
   >>> sco.download(nproc=4, path=path)
