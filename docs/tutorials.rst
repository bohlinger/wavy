The following tutorials describe how to setup the wavy config files, to retrieve satellite and insitu data, to perform collocation and validation tasks. **wavy** is intended to be fleksibel such that customization can be achieved with minimal changes in the code. The **wavy** config files build the fundament for this approach and serve a similar purpose as namelist files often used for runtime changes in numerical modelling.

e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd ~/wavy/wavy/apps
   $ ./wavyDownload.py -h

.. toctree::
